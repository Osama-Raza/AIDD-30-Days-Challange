*📁Part A — Theory (Short Questions)*  
**Answer in your own wording**  
1. Nine Pillars Understanding
   - Because AI handles repetitive tasks, it saves time and mental effort, allowing developers to focus on system architecture, improve planning, and deliver the best product with an optimal design.
   - M-Shaped developers now can learn multiple skills without investing much time on all domains of that particular skill. Which helps developer to think deeper and design better architecture with help of AIDD.
2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
   - Vibe Coding usually creates problems due to lack of planning, AI just provide you the code with no background and test. Often it appears to work in beginning but problem arises later. But at the time of production it fails. No extensibility is possible because it tightly coupled with logic. That means now developer need to change whole code.
   - Specification-Driven Development helps to decide specification first before starting the project. It helps developers to plan first, whole team knows the object clearly, developers can test against the specifications, knows what to do and why, and can add or change any function without hesitation which we face in vibe coding.
3. Architecture Thinking
   - Architecture-first changes the role of coder to system planner. Instead of planning to write code line by line. Developer just focus on specification, design and orchestrate the system while AI implement it.
   - Developers must think in layers and systems because writing raw code or syntax is now AI's job.
If a developer wants a task to be completed correctly, they must first provide clear  specifications for the AI to follow.
If the specifications are not clear, AI may not produce correct functions, and the system may not work.
