Now AI not only give code snippet or particular function it can make whole application with testing, error handling etc. While on other hand Human just think about problem, architecture and security system.
  When AI complete it task human review it's output and check is it giving desire output or crash at any undefined field and ensure that app meets user needs or not.
- How do you see the future ofHuman-AI Collaboration in software development?
  Future of Human-AI collaboration in software development is very bright. Because, before AI, human have to plan, make prototype, writing code from scratch, error -handling, de budding, testing all of these things was not too easy and was time taking. For these reasons many of people do not like software development. Now with help of AI all the things have become easier and time saving. Those tasks which need to take months now because of AI these tasks can be done in weeks or few days. Now person with less knowledge can make applications and softwares with help of AI.
  Now just tell me is it corrNow coders role will change into typist ect answer or not?
