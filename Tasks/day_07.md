1. ** What is spec-kit plus**. 
Spec-Kit Plus is an SDD-RI (Specification-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence) framework that transforms the way projects are built. It offers several benefits even before starting a project. The framework provides structured support for Constitution, Specification, Plan, Tasks, and Implementation, leveraging both AI and human interaction. It helps design the architecture of a product and implement it step by step, changing the traditional approach of ad-hoc coding. It allows writing specifications according to requirements and updating versions whenever needed.  

2. **Constitution**. 
Constitution is a foundation of any project. It describes the rules for team mate and AI companion, which everyone have to follow. Further acts will be held according to the constitutions. Constitution  contains global rules for a project which make it different from specification.  

3. **Specification**. 
Specification helps to describe project idea clear, measurable, and well-structured. It answers "what to do" instead of "how to do". A clear specification  creates, clear plan, clear task, and reflect high-quality output. Before writing the formal specification user should ask AI to clarify goals, criteria, and intent. Then after clarifying specification execute it by using command /sp specify.  

4. **Plan**. 
The objective of plan phase is to create an implementation plan of architecture, components, phases, and success criteria using /sp.plan command. It specifies "How the architecture will be built, and in how many steps". Plan plays the role of bridge from intent to workable task. Plan is generated from specification which enable quality checkpoints.  

5. **Task**. 
Task phase divides specification or plan into smaller and clear part by using /sp.tasks command. Tasks ensure a structure loop of (Agent Complete → Human Review → Human Approve → Continue). This loop ensures AI donot complete whole task in single go. Human can review every output and errors or mistakes can be identified earlier. The most important thing tasks are arranged in proper order.  

6. **Implmentation**


Implementation is the last phase which transform project specifications and plans into reality by executing tasks. Ai handle execution and validating results. You maintain control through checkpoints, not by walking away and hoping the AI completes the project autonomously. Work executes in phases separated by checkpoints. At each checkpoint, you answer one question "Does this meet the specification?" then decide:whether to correct or continue.
